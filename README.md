# KMeans & KMedoids Clustering Visualization

This React app demonstrates the **KMeans** and **KMedoids** clustering algorithms with interactive visualization. You can add points, select the number of clusters, choose the algorithm, and see how clusters form step-by-step, including centroid/medoid updates.

## Features

- Interactive 2D scatter plot to add data points by clicking.
- Choose between **KMeans** and **KMedoids** clustering.
- Adjustable number of clusters (`k`).
- Visual display of cluster assignments with color-coded points.
- Visualization of centroids (KMeans) or medoids (KMedoids) as squares.
- Iteration log showing centroid/medoid positions before and after updates.
- Real-time feedback and stable convergence detection.
